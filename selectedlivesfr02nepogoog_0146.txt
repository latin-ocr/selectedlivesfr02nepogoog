118 NOTES.

first period oi his presence, as then he held command; every·
thing else he may and probably did continue.

14. locus: properly an appositive with colonas, but it has been
attracted, as is usual in Latin, into the relative clause and agrees
with the relative.

15. cum . . . tum: not only . . . but also.

· 17. clava: this has reference to cylindrical pieces oi wood
possessed by the ephors, and carried by all generals on expedi·

attracted to inlitam see on qui, p. 5, l. 6.
