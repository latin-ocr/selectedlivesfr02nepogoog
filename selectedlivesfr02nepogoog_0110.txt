14. Pythia: in the most ancient times Delphi, a chief seat of
the worship of Apollo, was called Pytho, Apollo the Pythius, and
his priestesS, the Pythia. She uttered the oracles while seated
upon a tripod or three-legged stool; but as the sounds she made
were unintelligible to questioners, they were taken down by priests
of the temple, and in the form of hexameter verse communicated
to inquirers.

14. ut . . . sumerent: translate by an Eng. infinitive.

15. id si fecissent, etc} : Nepos suddenly drops into indirect
discourse, leaving us to supply dixit from praecepit. Consequently
fecissent is not in a condition contrary to fact (“iftl1ey haddone

With futura supply esse; it is the principal verb in the indirect
discourse.

by que'to vellet, repeat cum in thought. ut is frequently omitted
after certain classes of verbs (G. 331, f. R.; H. 499, 2).
