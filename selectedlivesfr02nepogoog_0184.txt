note; H. 455, 1) and strongly suggesting that by aliquis Diome·
don himself is meant.

16. ereptum: Epaminondas means to imply that if Diomedon

2 5. volumine: it was usual for each book to be written
upon a separate roll, but in case of great length more were used,

compare volume in English. (See Fig. 9 after note on vincla
epistulae, p. 23, 1. 13, showing a case of these rolls.)

Paae 46. 1. quirum: sc. vitam; the Latin rarely puts ah

volumen.

were written on sheets fastened together in long strips and rolled,
the ancients used to number roll (volumen) and line (versus).
