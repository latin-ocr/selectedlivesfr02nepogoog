NOTES. 109

24. Tamen: in emphatic position; in spite oi all these great
services,

z 5. timbrem: see on extimescebam, p. 8, l. 11.

26. testularum suffragiis: the so-called ostracism. After the
banishment oi Hippias, the Athenians, in order to prevent the
rise ol tyrants, hit upon a plan by which men whose influence
and power seemed dangerous to liberty, might be exiled for a

term ol years (originally ten, later fixed at five), with no loss of
property or honor; 6000 votes lor this purpose must be cast to
bring it about, and, as they wrote the name of the obnoxious
citizen on potsherds (ὄστρακα = testulae), they named this action
ostracism, or the judgment of the potsherds. ·

Pane 16. 1. Argis: accus. plur. ; the place was the capital
ol Argolis.

r. habitatum: a favorite way with Nepos ol expressing pur-
pose after verbs of motion is the supine in um; cf deliberr'ttum,
p. 1, l; 10.

2. virtutes: probably services to Argos.

2. Lacedaemonii . . . miserunt,etc..· 473 ne. Pausanias the
Spartan king had been convicted of treasonable correspondence
with the Persian king. After his death letters were found in his
house which implicated Themistocles.

*4 rige Perse: this differs from rege Persarum byimplying
that the king is ol the same blood as his subjects, which need
not be true of the second phrase.

4. prdditit'tnis: with damnatus est, not with crimine.

7. Argis: plural as in the case of many ancient towns, prob
ably originally adjectives, ag, the Argive villages; the Athenian
villages; then becoming Argi and Athenae. Cf. Argis, l. 1.

8. iis: sibi would be more regular, but as Nepos has already
used se in this clause referring to Themistocles the subject of
animadvertisset, he could hardly avoid the change of pronoun.

ιο. Molossum=u1010ssurum They lived originally in the
interior of Epirus, but later possessed the whole country. Their
kings claimed descent from Neoptolemus, son of Achilles.
