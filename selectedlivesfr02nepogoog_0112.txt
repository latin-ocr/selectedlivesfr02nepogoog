84 , NOTES.

14. quemvis: we should expect quamquam, as the indicative
follows. Perhaps this is a mistalre‚ though it occurs once else·
where in Nepos.

15. nomine: an abl. of separation with careri, be without.

15. neque id magis . . .quam: trans. affirmatively, less by
...than Cf neque minus...quam aboveinl. 10.

16. neque: often best trans. but. . . not.

16. eb: on that account.

17. quibus rebus: see on cirins generis, p. 1, l. 7.

19. obtineret: maintain or retain in English; avoid trans·
lating obtain. ⁴

sonesus had been settled in this way.

21. revertitur: Nepos continues his narrative in the socalled
historical present, making the events go on as it were before our
eyes (G. 276, d ; H. 467, 111).

. 21. 'ex pacto: ex in this and similar expressions means in
accordance with. ·

22. sibi: refers to subject of postulat.

22. illi enim dixerant: we look here for illos dixisse, parallel
to se habere below, both dependent on the word of saying implied
in postulet (see note on id si fecissent, p. 1, l. 15, above). We
may consider the statement a parenthetical one, thrown in by
Nepos to explain to the reader the pacto referred to.

22. cum: with the verb. ,

22. vento botei: substituted for vento aquilone, used in p. 1,
l. 21. Both are names for north or northeast wind.

24. Chersonesi: locative case. Treated by Nepos as the
name of a town, or small island. Cf. p. 1, l. 7, chersonesum.

26. sion: abl. of cause . . . parallel to femini. adversariorum
also goes with dicto.

Pane 3. 1. ausi nbn sunt: curious order; the perfect indi-
cative of auderi.
