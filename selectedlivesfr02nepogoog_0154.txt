126 NOTES.

ὀστρακισμόν; quod refers to the whole idea contained in the ex·
pression testarum suffragiis, hence the neuter.

5. exsilio: the Spartans, in serious plight owing to a rising
of the Helots, sent to Athens for help. Cimon induced the
Athenians to send troops, but as the Spartans, becoming sus-
picious of them, sent the men back, the people visited their in-
dignation upon Cimon, accusing him of being opposed to the
interests of the people and a sympathizer with Sparta. Probably
the reasons given in Milt. 8, 1, in the caseos the father, apply
here also in the case of the son. ,

5. celerius: not strictly true, as Cimon wished to rejoin his
countrymen at the battle of Tanagra (see below), but was not
allowed to do so.

6. paenituit: impersonal as always; followed by accus. and

en.
g 7. bellumque Lacedaemonii: the schemes of Pericles for ex·
tending Athenian sway over upper Greece received a check in the
defeat of the Athenians at Tanagra in Boeotia (4 58) by a Spartan

force ; after the victory the Spartans returned to Peloponnesus.

ro. Post: separated from quam by tmesis; thus frequently
priusquam, antequam always translate as one word at the point
where quam comes in the text.

10. expulsus erat: the perfect indicative usually follows pout·
quam; but whenever a definite amount of time is given, the plu-
perfect is used. Cimon was recalled in 4 57 3 the five years' peace
was not arranged till 451.

11. hospitio: almost all Greek states had their guest-friend-
ships. The socalled πρόξενοι, hospites, performed a duty some·
what similar to that of our modern consuls, but this difference
is to be noted ε the American consul at Liverpool ag. is an Ameri-
can citizen who takes up his residence there when appointed; the
Spartan representative at Athens was an Athenian. He, how-
ever, was expected to help and befriend any Lacedaemonian who
came to Athens. See on hospitium, p. 16, l. 11. -

13. sui sponte: ie. not sent officially3 cf the same words
in p. 22, l. 5.
