The airn in the notes has been to supply needed infor·
mation where Nepos is over-brief or in error, to explain
real difficulties in syntax, andro add to the pupil's interest
by giving illustrations of objects mentioned in the text.
The editions of Nepos by Nipperdey (Lupus), Siebeiis

(Jancovius) and Karl Erbe have been drawn upon in the
preparation of the notes ⁴

References have been made to the grammars of Allen
and Greenough, and Harkness. That these references
will be found less frequent than in many elementary text-
books is due to the editor's belief that constant references
to the grammar often prove interruptions rather than heips
to the pupils.

it remains for the editor to express his indebtedness to
the editors-inchief of this series, Messrs. William C. Collar ⁹
and John Tetlow. Their assistance has been constant
while the book was going through the press‚ and their
suggestions and criticisms many and valuable.
