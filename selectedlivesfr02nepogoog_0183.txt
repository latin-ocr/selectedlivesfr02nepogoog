NOTES. 155

2. Diomedonte: abl. governed by the prep. coram, which some-
times follows its case.

3. Nihil: not ot oll,· an emphatic ndu: an adverbial accus.

3. pecdnii: abl. of separation following opus (G. 243 e, but
see also iootuote3 H. 414, IV).

4. gratiis: the abl. plural oi gratia used adverbially; later
contracted into gretie, which has been adopted into English.

5. sin autem: autem strengthens the adversative iorce of ein.

6. Namque. . . cariore: For I wt'll not surrender (accipere,
lit. accept) my love for my country in exchongefor (pro) tte wealth
os the world ,· this causes the object oi the verb and the word
⁵ governed by prd to exchange places, but seems to express the
idea naturally.

8. tui: gen. dependent on similem (G. 234d[ ]; H. 391, II.
ruu-

verb occasions no confusion, but remember that in fully inflected
verbs the present infinitivo act. and the present imperative pass.
(sing.) have exactly the same form.

12. iacis: the action is to be immediate (confestim), and is
not regarded as future though tradam stands in the apodosis;
by rule we should have feceris, which in English oddly enough

moriere virgis (you shall be floggcd to death) nini milri signum
uantur.

13. tuto: adv. ι

13. exiret: we should expect liceret sibi exire, as below liceret.

H. 450).
