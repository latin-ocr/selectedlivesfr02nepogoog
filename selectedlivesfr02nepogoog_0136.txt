108 NOTES.

ally, his way was done.

7. praedixit: vuarned them besoreleand,· prae has its own force
in this compound, while dixit has borrowed some of the force of

7. ut nd: equivalent to ne alone, common in Cicero, rare else
where. ⁴

11. liberrime: with perfect srankness.

12. quod . . .poasent: we should not look for this clause till

12. deda pt'tblicds: the gods worshiped everywhere in Greece;

patrids those worshiped in Attica proper; penates, those of
each family.

in building the walls were simply the defense of the gods; in ed:
refers to mv'rrds saepsisse; supply quiequam before quod inutile.

16. oppositum: conforms in gender to the emphatic predicate
appositive propugnaculum, instead of to urbem.

17. apud quam iam bis: ie, through the battles of Marathon
and Salamis ; the expression is a figurative one with no especial
reference to fighting on sea as opposed to fighting on land3
apud quam=et apud eam, hence the infinitive construction is
continued.

fied are constantly used of the king of Persia and his concerns.

19. qui = cum ii, causal clause since they.

22. se: i.e., Themistocles.
