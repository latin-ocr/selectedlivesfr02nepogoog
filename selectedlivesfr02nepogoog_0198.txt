SvnoPsts-Agesilaus gets the throne but not without a
struggle (1). He sets out to free Asia; he faithfully abides by
a truce he makes with the Persians (2). Both in arms and in
strategy he vanquishes the Persians (3). Summoned home
because of the Corinthian war, he obeys and defeats his enemies
at Coronea (4). Far from boasting of his victories, he laments
the unhappy state of Greece (5). After the battle of Leuctra he
saves Sparta from destruction (6). He helps his distressed
country by all means in his power ; he lives very plainly (⁷). The
Egyptians look with scorn upon his ill-shaped body and sim·
plicity of dress. He dies on his way home from Egypt (8).
