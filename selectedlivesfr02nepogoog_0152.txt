followed the taking of Scyrus (ᾗ 5). Cimon won his double vic-
tory-with fleet and army—on the river Eurymedon in Pam·
phylia in southern Asia Minor (465), and by this put an end to
Persian power in any part of Hellas. The sea-light at Mycale, a
promontory opposite Sarnos, was won by the Greeks under Leo
tychides the Spartan on the same day ori which the battle of
Plataea was fought (479), and Cimon had nothing to do with it.
Cimon captured Eion at the mouth of the Strymon in Thrace
from the Persians and held it against fierce attacks. The site of
Amphipolis lay farther up the river, and though Cimon personally
did not take part, the first attempt to establish a colony there
was made during this campaign. The 1o,ooo settlers were anni-
hilated by the Thracians during an expedition into the interior.
Not till 437 was a permanent colony established at Amphipolis.
